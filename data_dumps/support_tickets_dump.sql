131	42	Hello,\n\nCould you please provide more details about the caching system you are using? Information like the type of caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) and the specific error messages would be really helpful for us to troubleshoot this effectively.\n\nThank you!	2024-07-14 08:30:00+00	2024
132	42	Hi,\n\nWe are using Redis for caching, and we are seeing errors related to memory limits being reached. The service is slowing down significantly, and requests are timing out.\n\nWe are on version 2.42.0 of Hasura.	2024-07-15 10:15:00+00	55
133	42	Thanks for the information. \n\nIt seems like you might need to adjust the memory settings for your Redis instance. Could you let me know what your current memory limits are set to? \n\nI will try to find the correct configuration for you.	2024-07-16 11:00:00+00	2024
134	42	We currently have a limit of 2GB set for Redis. We are also experiencing high traffic, and I suspect that might be part of the issue.	2024-07-17 09:45:00+00	55
135	42	I see. \n\nIn high-traffic scenarios, it might be best to increase the memory limit. However, I am not entirely sure how to do that in your deployment. \n\nMaybe you could check your cloud provider's documentation for guidance?	2024-07-18 14:00:00+00	2024
136	42	I've checked and it seems we can increase the memory limit to 4GB. Do you think that would help resolve the issue?	2024-07-19 15:30:00+00	55
137	42	Yes, increasing it to 4GB should definitely help alleviate the resource exhaustion issues. \n\nBut I am not completely certain about how quickly this change would take effect. Maybe you can try restarting the Redis service after the change?	2024-07-20 16:15:00+00	2024
138	42	We've made the change and restarted the service. The performance seems to have improved, but we are still seeing some intermittent slowdowns.	2024-07-21 12:00:00+00	55
139	42	Hmm, that's not ideal. \n\nIt might also be worth checking the number of active connections to Redis. Too many connections can also cause performance degradation. \n\nIf you could monitor that, it would help us understand the problem better.	2024-07-22 13:45:00+00	2024
140	42	We monitored the connections, and they are within acceptable limits. It seems the issues are still persisting. I appreciate your help so far.	2024-07-23 10:30:00+00	55

411	123	Hi there,\n\nThanks for reaching out regarding the performance issues you're facing with permissions operations in your Hasura project. I'm looking into this and will get back to you soon.\n\nBest,\nHasura Support	2024-11-20 06:01:00+00	3072
412	123	Hi,\n\nI did some preliminary checks and noticed that the issue could be related to how the permissions are structured. Can you provide more details about your current setup? Like, how many roles do you have and what kind of permissions are configured?	2024-11-21 07:00:00+00	3072
413	123	Hello,\n\nWe have about 5 roles configured, and the permissions are quite granular. We are trying to restrict access based on user attributes and other factors. It's been working okay until recently, but now it seems slow.	2024-11-22 08:30:00+00	181
414	123	Thanks for the info. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the complexity of the permissions check might be causing the slowdown. Could you try simplifying some of the permissions temporarily and see if performance improves?	2024-11-23 09:15:00+00	3072
415	123	We tried simplifying the permissions, but it didn't help much. The performance is still not where it should be. Our users are getting frustrated.	2024-11-24 10:45:00+00	181
416	123	Oh, that’s not good. I'm struggling to find a reason for this. Have you checked if there are any long-running queries in your PostgreSQL logs? Sometimes they can affect overall performance.	2024-11-25 11:30:00+00	3072
417	123	Yes, we found some long-running queries that seem to be related to the permissions checks. We're working on optimizing those queries now.	2024-11-26 12:00:00+00	181
418	123	That sounds like a step in the right direction. I’m not really sure, but maybe consider indexing the columns that are being filtered in those queries? It might help with performance.	2024-11-27 13:15:00+00	3072
419	123	We have added indexes to a few columns, and it seems to be improving the performance a bit. Still, we’re not back to normal yet.	2024-11-28 14:30:00+00	181
420	123	I appreciate your patience. I'm really trying to figure this out. Perhaps we could also look at optimizing the metadata queries? Sometimes they can also contribute to performance issues. If you could share the details, it might help.	2024-11-29 15:45:00+00	3072
421	123	Thanks for your help! We’ll continue to monitor the performance and let you know if we see any improvements or if we need further assistance. I hope we can resolve these issues soon!	2024-11-30 16:00:00+00	181

456	137	Here are the queries I am trying to run:\n\n1. `query { products { id name } }`\n2. `mutation { insert_products(objects: { id: 1, name: "Test" }) { returning { id } } }`\n\nThe errors I receive are:\n1. Access Denied for query\n2. Access Denied for mutation\n\nThanks for your help!	2022-11-11 13:00:00+00	203
457	137	Thanks for sharing those details!\n\nIt appears that the issue is related to the hierarchy of permissions in your MySQL database. I recommend checking the role hierarchy and ensuring that the 'user' role inherits the correct permissions from its parent roles, if any.\n\nLet me know how it goes!	2022-11-12 15:30:00+00	2678
458	137	I have verified the hierarchy, and it seems that everything is set correctly. I also made sure the permissions are inherited properly.\n\nStill having issues. What do you suggest next?	2022-11-13 16:00:00+00	203
459	137	At this point, I recommend double-checking the role assignments for the users in question. Sometimes, a user might not be assigned the role as expected.\n\nPlease verify this and let me know if it resolves the issue.\n\nBest,\nHasura Support	2022-11-14 09:00:00+00	2678
460	137	I checked the role assignments and it turns out that the users were not assigned the 'user' role correctly. I have fixed that and now everything is working perfectly!\n\nThank you so much for your assistance!\n\nBest regards!	2022-11-15 10:00:00+00	203
461	137	You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that the issue has been resolved. If you need further assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nBest,\nHasura Support	2022-11-16 11:00:00+00	2678
462	138	Hi there,\n\nI’m sorry to hear you’re having issues with the schema registry when handling permissions. This can be quite tricky to sort out. Could you provide more details on what specific errors or behaviors you are encountering? Are there any particular actions that lead to the schema registry breaking?\n\nThanks for your patience as we work through this together.\n\nBest,\nHasura Support	2024-09-04 02:00:00+00	3072
