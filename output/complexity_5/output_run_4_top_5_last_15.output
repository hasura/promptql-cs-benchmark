We haven't made any recent changes to our setup, so we're unsure what's causing this issue.\\\\n\\\\nCould you please help us investigate and resolve this problem?\\\\n\\\\nThank you,\\\\n[Your Name]\\\\n\\\\nProject ID: 5ad39764-9b9b-48cb-8819-43ab40694b06\\\\n\\\", 'created_at': '2024-08-20T02:00:00+00:00'}\\n]\\n\\n# Plans details\\nticket_plans = {\\n    \\\"2a8d4b07-c391-450f-8153-f6521f8a20a0\\\": \\\"base\\\",\\n    \\\"76de9616-3d7b-49d7-b909-e154dda91489\\\": \\\"free\\\",\\n    \\\"386d8856-9020-47eb-a21a-2ebe6b81428e\\\": \\\"advanced\\\",\\n    \\\"d5dc02fc-707a-4084-854a-79f5866d4dd3\\\": \\\"base\\\",\\n    \\\"5ad39764-9b9b-48cb-8819-43ab40694b06\\\": \\\"base\\\",\\n    \\\"9b8f8c9a-7f76-4bc2-95c9-652b13f13a44\\\": \\\"free\\\",\\n    \\\"8edf6e2c-99b6-49af-b342-4aefe811b2f3\\\": \\\"base\\\",\\n    \\\"5f4d1be1-61b7-4b11-ba51-6e9b7f094c82\\\": \\\"advanced\\\",\\n    \\\"b750445e-fba4-4644-b306-1550cfefad8b\\\": \\\"base\\\",\\n    \\\"e452f72b-66e1-4c56-ada2-3525ab8fb280\\\": \\\"advanced\\\",\\n    \\\"e75d06e3-6ec1-4649-bc83-7d19cd07fd77\\\": \\\"advanced\\\",\\n    \\\"4aeefe6f-7dee-4395-82be-6d8e51aea9fd\\\": \\\"advanced\\\"\\n}\\n\\n# Plans mapping\\ntitle_to_category_plan_priority = {\\n    \\\"advanced\\\": 3,\\n    \\\"base\\\": 2,\\n    \\\"free\\\": 1\\n}\\n\\ncategory_priority_order = {\\n    \\\"downtime\\\": 5,\\n    \\\"reliability\\\": 4,\\n    \\\"performance\\\": 3,\\n    \\\"bug\\\": 2,\\n    \\\"feature request\\\": 1,\\n    \\\"others\\\": 0\\n}\\n\\n# Categorize tickets\\n\\ndef categorize_ticket(description):\\n    # Lowercase description for easier searching\\n    lower_desc = description.lower()\\n    \\n    if \\\"inability to access\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"500 errors\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"production environment outages\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"outage\\\" in lower_desc:\\n        return \\\"downtime\\\"\\n    elif \\\"random request failures\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"service instability\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"intermittent connectivity\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"intermittent failures\\\" in lower_desc:\\n        return \\\"reliability\\\"\\n    elif \\\"performance degradation\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"increased response times\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"latency\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"slow response\\\" in lower_desc:\\n        return \\\"performance\\\"\\n    elif \\\"bug\\\" in lower_desc:\\n        return \\\"bug\\\"\\n    elif \\\"feature\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"feature request\\\" in lower_desc or \\\"enhancement\\\" in lower_desc:\\n        return \\\"feature request\\\"\\n    else:\\n        return \\\"others\\\"\\n\\n# Extract project IDs\\ndef extract_project_id(description):\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r\\\"\\\\b[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}\\\\b\\\", description)\\n    \\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(0)\\n    return None\\n\\n# Pairwise comparison function\\ndef compare_tickets(t1, t2):\\n    # Compare based on plan and category\\n    project_id_1 = extract_project_id(t1[\\\"description\\\"])\\n    project_id_2 = extract_project_id(t2[\\\"description\\\"])\\n    plan_1 = ticket_plans.get(project_id_1, \\\"others\\\")\\n    plan_2 = ticket_plans.get(project_id_2, \\\"others\\\")\\n    category_1 = categorize_ticket(t1[\\\"description\\\"])\\n    category_2 = categorize_ticket(t2[\\\"description\\\"])\\n\\n    # Add additional prioritization rules\\n    priority_a = title_to_category_plan_priority.get(plan_1, 0)\\n    priority_b = title_to_category_plan_priority.get(plan_2, 0)\\n\\n    if priority_a and category_1 in [\\\"downtime\\\", \\\"reliability\\\"]:\\n        priority_a += category_priority_order[category_1]\\n    if priority_b and category_2 in [\\\"downtime\\\", \\\"reliability\\\"]:\\n        priority_b += category_priority_order[category_2]\\n\\n    # Compare effective priorities\\n    if priority_a != priority_b:\\n        return priority_b - priority_a\\n\\n    # Compare all categories\\n    if category_priority_order[category_1] != category_priority_order[category_2]:\\n        return category_priority_order[category_2] - category_priority_order[category_1]\\n\\n    # Compare based on creation time\\n    date_1 = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(t1[\\\"created_at\\\"])\\n    date_2 = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(t2[\\\"created_at\\\"])\\n\\n    # Older date should have higher priority\\n    return (date_1 > date_2) - (date_1 < date_2)\\n\\n# Sort tickets\\nsorted_tickets = sorted(last_15_open_tickets, key=cmp_to_key(compare_tickets))\\n\\ntop_5_tickets = sorted_tickets[:5]\\n\\nprint(top_5_tickets)\"}",
