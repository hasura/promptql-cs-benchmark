Query:
Give me a sorted list of top 5 support tickets which I should prioritize amongst the last 5 open tickets (i.e., status = 'open').

For each ticket do the following:
- intelligently extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the time the ticket was created at
- classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures and service instability, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Now sort the tickets in the order of priority, by comparing them pairwise using these rules one by one in order (moving to the next rule if the previous rule is a tie).
- If a ticket is on the advanced plan with category 'downtime' or 'reliability', it should be prioritized higher.
- Prioritize the ticket based on categories using this order: downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request > others
- Compare ticket creation times to prioritize the older ticket.

Return the list of ticket IDs inside the tags <tickets> </tickets> with a single ticket ID in a single line
Example:
<ticket>
123
987
</ticket>

Response:
It seems that the project to plan mapping did not return any results. This usually means that either the `project_plan_changelogs` table doesn't have recent plan entries for the requested project IDs or some other issue occurred.

Let's proceed with the prioritization using fallback logic that doesn't rely on plan information explicitly. Since advanced plan information isn't available, I'll prioritize using the other rules provided i.e. category and ticket creation time. 

### Ticket Categorization based on descriptions:

1. **Ticket ID 143**: 
   - Category: Downtime
   - Created At: 2025-01-03

2. **Ticket ID 166**: 
   - Category: Feature request
   - Created At: 2024-12-21

3. **Ticket ID 209**: 
   - Category: Downtime
   - Created At: 2024-12-05

4. **Ticket ID 169**: 
   - Category: Performance
   - Created At: 2024-11-12

5. **Ticket ID 251**: 
   - Category: Performance
   - Created At: 2024-10-25

### Priority Decision:

1. **Downtime**: ID 209, ID 143
2. **Performance**: ID 251, ID 169
3. **Feature Request**: ID 166

Now, I'll provide the sorted list of ticket IDs as per the above priority analysis:

<tickets>
209
143
251
169
166
