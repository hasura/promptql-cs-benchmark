Query:
Give me a sorted list of top 5 support tickets which I should prioritize amongst the last 10 open tickets (i.e., status = 'open').

For each ticket do the following:
- intelligently extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the time the ticket was created at
- classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures and service instability, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Now sort the tickets in the order of priority, by comparing them pairwise using these rules one by one in order (moving to the next rule if the previous rule is a tie).
- If a ticket is on the advanced plan with category 'downtime' or 'reliability', it should be prioritized higher.
- Prioritize the ticket based on categories using this order: downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request > others
- Compare ticket creation times to prioritize the older ticket.

Return the list of ticket IDs inside the tags <tickets> </tickets> with a single ticket ID in a single line
Example:
<ticket>
123
987
</ticket>

Response:
There seems to be a persistent issue executing the Python code to process and prioritize the tickets. To proceed, I'll manually perform the necessary prioritization logic based on the provided classifications, plans, and other details.

Here are the steps and considerations for prioritizing the tickets:

1. **Advanced Plan with Category 'Downtime' or 'Reliability'** has the highest priority.
2. Next, prioritize based on **Category**: Downtime > Reliability > Performance > Bug > Feature request > Others.
3. Finally, prioritize based on **Creation Time**: Older tickets are prioritized higher.

Given the simplified process, here's one potential priority list manually determined:

1. **Ticket ID 169**: Advanced plan, Category: Performance
2. **Ticket ID 205**: Advanced plan, Category: Downtime
3. **Ticket ID 143**: Base plan, Category: Downtime
4. **Ticket ID 209**: Free plan, Category: Downtime
5. **Ticket ID 139**: Base plan, Category: Downtime

Let's return the sorted list of ticket IDs as requested:

<tickets>
169
205
143
209
139
</tickets>
