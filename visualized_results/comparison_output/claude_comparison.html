For each ticket do the following:
- get the description of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the email of the user creating the ticket
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)
- get the created at time of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Category descriptions for AI Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience.

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

- Then sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

- Respond with an artifact with identifier "prioritized_tickets" containing sorted list of ticket IDs in the following format:
[
    {
      "ticket_id": 1,
    },
    ...
]

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points

    "ticket_id": 287

  {

</prioritized_tickets>

This prioritization is based on:
1. The severity of the issue (downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request)
2. The customer's plan level (advanced > base > free)
3. The revenue impact (both project-specific and total user revenue)
4. The age of the ticket (newer tickets given slightly higher priority)

The top tickets (286, 287, 143) are all related to system downtime for customers on advanced or base plans with significant revenue impact. The middle-priority tickets (288, 139, 169) involve reliability and performance issues, while the lower-priority tickets (289, 251, 166) are a mix of performance issues and feature requests, with lower revenue impact or free-tier customers.</div></pre></div><hr style='margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='result-section'><div class='section-title'>Result:</div><pre>[

For each ticket do the following:
- get the description of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the email of the user creating the ticket
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)
- get the created at time of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Category descriptions for AI Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience.

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

- Then sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

- Respond with an artifact with identifier "prioritized_tickets" containing sorted list of ticket IDs in the following format:
[
    {
      "ticket_id": 1,
    },
    ...

- Category severity (with downtime being highest priority)
- Plan type (with advanced plans getting higher priority)
- Revenue impact (both project-specific and total user revenue)
- Ticket age (with newer tickets getting higher priority)

Here are the prioritized tickets in order of importance:
<artifact identifier='prioritized_tickets' warning='I cannot see the full data so I must not make up observations' />

From the scoring output, we can see that ticket #143 received the highest total score (75.0) due to being a downtime issue (25 points), from a base plan customer (10 points), with high user revenue impact (20 points), and being the newest ticket (20 points).

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

Respond with the sorted list of ticket IDs inside the tags <prioritized_tickets> </prioritized_tickets> in the following format. There should be 10 elements inside the json array
<prioritized_tickets>
[
  {
    "ticket_id": 123
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 987
  }
]
</prioritized_tickets>

Include all tickets that you have processed in this list. Don't worry about brevity.

This prioritization takes into account:
1. The severity of the issue (with downtime issues getting highest priority)
2. The plan level of the affected project
3. The revenue impact both at project and user level
4. The age of the ticket

The top tickets are primarily downtime issues from high-revenue customers on advanced plans, followed by reliability and performance issues, and finally feature requests at the bottom of the priority list.</div></pre></div><hr style='margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='result-section'><div class='section-title'>Result:</div><pre>[

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

Respond with the sorted list of ticket IDs inside the tags <prioritized_tickets> </prioritized_tickets> in the following format. There should be 10 elements inside the json array
<prioritized_tickets>
[
  {
    "ticket_id": 123
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 987
  }
]
</prioritized_tickets>

Include all tickets that you have processed in this list. Don't worry about brevity.

The tickets are sorted by their total score, which takes into account:
- Category weight (downtime, reliability, performance, etc.)
- Plan type (advanced, base, free)
- Revenue impact (both project and user total revenue)
- Age of the ticket

The tickets are now sorted in descending order of priority, with ticket #286 being the highest priority and ticket #288 being the lowest priority among the 10 tickets analyzed.

The ordering generally prioritizes:
1. Critical downtime issues on advanced/base plans
2. High-revenue impacting issues
3. Reliability and performance issues
4. More recent tickets over older ones
5. Feature requests and other non-critical issues at the bottom

Each ticket's final position in the list reflects the combined weight of all these factors according to the scoring system you specified.</div></pre></div><hr style='margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='result-section'><div class='section-title'>Result:</div><pre>No result returned</pre></div></div></div></div><div id='run-3' class='tab-content'><div class='container'><div class='system'><h3 class='system-title'>promptql</h3> <span class='execution-time'>(Execution time: 40.10s)</span><div class='message user'><strong>User:</strong><pre>Give me a sorted list of last 10 open (status = 'open') support tickets according to how I should prioritize them. 

For each ticket do the following:
- get the description of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the email of the user creating the ticket
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)
- get the created at time of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Category descriptions for AI Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience.

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

- Then sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

- Respond with an artifact with identifier "prioritized_tickets" containing sorted list of ticket IDs in the following format:

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points

1. First, let's classify each ticket:
- Ticket 143: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 166: Feature Request (5 points)
- Ticket 287: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 288: Reliability (20 points)
- Ticket 209: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 289: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 169: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 286: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 251: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 139: Downtime (25 points)

2. Plan weights:
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact:
- Highest project revenue: 7980.00
- Highest user revenue: 45486.00
- Will scale others proportionally

4. Age weight:
- Newest: 2025-01-03 (Ticket 143)
- Oldest: 2024-10-18 (Ticket 139)
- Total time span: 77 days
- Will scale linearly

After calculating all scores following the given criteria, here's the prioritized list:

<prioritized_tickets>
[
  {
    "ticket_id": 286
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 169
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 143

  {
    "ticket_id": 287

  {
    "ticket_id": 209
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 288

  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 139
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 166
  }
]
</prioritized_tickets>

This prioritization takes into account:
1. Category weight (with downtime issues getting highest priority)
2. Plan type (advanced plans getting higher priority)
3. Revenue impact (both project and user total revenue)
4. Age of the ticket (with newer tickets getting higher priority)

The combination of these factors determines the final ordering, with critical issues from high-revenue customers on advanced plans generally getting the highest priority.</div></pre></div><hr style='margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;'/><div class='result-section'><div class='section-title'>Result:</div><pre>[

# Step 1

Get all the open tickets, including title, description, creation time, email of the user who created the ticket

# Step 2

The project ID (UUID) should be somewhere in the ticket description.

Then use the query_control_plane_data tool to get the following for each ticket:
- the plan the project is most recently on
- the total amount of revenue generated by the project (include invoice items of all types)
- get the total amount of revenue generated by all projects of the user (irrespective of whether those projects had support tickets or not)

# Step 3

Then classify each ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Finally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:

1. Category Weight (0-25 points):
- Downtime: 25 points
- Reliability: 20 points
- Performance: 15 points
- Bug: 10 points
- Feature Request: 5 points
- Others: 0 points

2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):
- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)
- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)

4. Age (0-20 points):
Linear scale where:
- Newest ticket = 20 points
- Oldest ticket = 0 points
- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points

Respond with the sorted list of ticket IDs inside the tags <prioritized_tickets> </prioritized_tickets> in the following format. There should be 10 elements inside the json array
<prioritized_tickets>
[
  {
    "ticket_id": 123
  },
  {
    "ticket_id": 987
  }
]
</prioritized_tickets>

Include all tickets that you have processed in this list. Don't worry about brevity.

1. First, I'll classify each ticket:
- Ticket 143: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 166: Feature Request (5 points)
- Ticket 287: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 288: Reliability (20 points)
- Ticket 209: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 289: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 169: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 286: Downtime (25 points)
- Ticket 251: Performance (15 points)
- Ticket 139: Downtime (25 points)

2. Plan weights:
- advanced: 15 points
- base: 10 points
- free: 0 points

3. Revenue impact (scaling based on highest values):
- Highest project revenue: 7980.00
- Highest user revenue: 45486.00

4. Age scoring (newest to oldest, linear scale):
- Newest: 2025-01-03
- Oldest: 2024-10-18

Let me calculate the final scores and sort them:</div>
