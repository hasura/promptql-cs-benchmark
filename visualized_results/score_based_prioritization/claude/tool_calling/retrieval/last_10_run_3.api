First, let's classify each ticket:\n- Ticket 143: Downtime (25 points)\n- Ticket 166: Feature Request (5 points)\n- Ticket 287: Downtime (25 points)\n- Ticket 288: Reliability (20 points)\n- Ticket 209: Downtime (25 points)\n- Ticket 289: Performance (15 points)\n- Ticket 169: Performance (15 points)\n- Ticket 286: Downtime (25 points)\n- Ticket 251: Performance (15 points)\n- Ticket 139: Downtime (25 points)\n\n2. Plan weights:\n- advanced: 15 points\n- base: 10 points\n- free: 0 points\n\n3. Revenue Impact:\n- Highest project revenue: 7980.00\n- Highest user revenue: 45486.00\n- Will scale others proportionally\n\n4. Age weight:\n- Newest: 2025-01-03 (Ticket 143)\n- Oldest: 2024-10-18 (Ticket 139)\n- Total time span: 77 days\n- Will scale linearly\n\nAfter calculating all scores following the given criteria, here's the prioritized list:\n\n<prioritized_tickets>\n[\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 286\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 169\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 143\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 287\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 209\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 288\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 289\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 251\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 139\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 166\n  }\n]\n</prioritized_tickets>\n\nThis prioritization takes into account:\n1. Category weight (with downtime issues getting highest priority)\n2. Plan type (advanced plans getting higher priority)\n3. Revenue impact (both project and user total revenue)\n4. Age of the ticket (with newer tickets getting higher priority)\n\nThe combination of these factors determines the final ordering, with critical issues from high-revenue customers on advanced plans generally getting the highest priority.",
