user_message: |
  Give me a sorted list of top {k} support tickets which I should prioritize amongst the last {n} open tickets (i.e., status = 'open').
  
  For each ticket, get the time the ticket was created at

  Now prioritize the tickets based on the time it was created giving higher priority to older ticket.

  Return the list of ticket IDs inside the tags <tickets> </tickets> with a single ticket ID in a single line
  Example:
  <tickets>
  123
  987
  </tickets>
