Ticket #143: Base plan with downtime (unable to access project)\n4. Ticket #215: Base plan with reliability (intermittent failures in Actions feature)\n5. Ticket #144: Free plan with downtime (500 errors on all operations)\n\nThe sorting followed these rules:\n1. Advanced plan tickets with downtime/reliability issues came first\n2. Base plan tickets with downtime/reliability issues came next\n3. Within the same plan+category combination, older tickets were prioritized\n4. Free plan tickets, even with downtime, came after base plan tickets with reliability issues due to the prioritization rules\n\nEach ticket was classified based on its description and subject, with keywords like \"down\", \"500 error\", \"unreachable\" indicating downtime, and \"intermittent\", \"randomly breaking\" indicating reliability issues. The project IDs were extracted from the ticket descriptions, and the corresponding plan information was used for prioritization.",
