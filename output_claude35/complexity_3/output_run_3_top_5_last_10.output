Ticket 143: Downtime issue (cannot access project)\n\nThe tickets are prioritized based on:\n1. Advanced plan customers with downtime/reliability issues (Ticket 205)\n2. Category priority (all these tickets are downtime issues, which have highest priority)\n3. Creation time (older tickets prioritized over newer ones)\n\nThese tickets should be addressed in this order to minimize impact on customers, with special attention to the advanced plan customer experiencing downtime (Ticket 205).",
