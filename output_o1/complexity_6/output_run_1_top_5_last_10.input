Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.\n\n2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures and service instability, affecting system reliability and user experience. \n\n3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. \n\n4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  \n\n5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. \n\n6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories\n\nNow sort the tickets in the order of priority, by comparing them pairwise using these rules one by one in order (moving to the next rule if the previous rule is a tie).\n- If a ticket is on the advanced plan with category 'downtime' or 'reliability', it should be prioritized higher.\n- If a ticket is on the base or free plan with category 'downtime', it should be prioritized higher.\n- Compare net revenue for the ticket's respective projects to prioritize the higher revenue project.\n- Compare ticket creation times to prioritize the older ticket.\n\nReturn the list of ticket IDs inside the tags <tickets> </tickets> with a single ticket ID in a single line\nExample:\n<tickets>\n123\n987\n</tickets>"
