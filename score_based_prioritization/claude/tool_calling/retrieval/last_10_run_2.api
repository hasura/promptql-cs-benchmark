Age (0-20 points, linear scale from oldest to newest)\n\nThe highest project revenue is 7980.00 and the highest user revenue is 45486.00.\n\nAfter calculating all scores and sorting them by total priority score (sum of all weights), here is the prioritized list:\n\n<prioritized_tickets>\n[\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 287\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 286\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 143\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 209\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 169\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 288\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 289\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 139\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 251\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 166\n  }\n]\n</prioritized_tickets>\n\nThis prioritization takes into account:\n1. The severity of the issue (with downtime issues getting highest priority)\n2. The plan level of the affected project\n3. The revenue impact both at project and user level\n4. The age of the ticket\n\nThe top tickets are primarily downtime issues from high-revenue customers on advanced plans, followed by reliability and performance issues, and finally feature requests at the bottom of the priority list.",
