Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.\n\n2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures, service instability or intermittent errors, affecting system reliability and user experience. \n\n3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. \n\n4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  \n\n5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. \n\n6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories\n\nFinally, sort the tickets in order of priority using the following scoring:\n\n1. Category Weight (0-25 points):\n- Downtime: 25 points\n- Reliability: 20 points\n- Performance: 15 points\n- Bug: 10 points\n- Feature Request: 5 points\n- Others: 0 points\n\n2. Plan Weight (0-15 points):\n- advanced: 15 points\n- base: 10 points\n- free: 0 points\n\n3. Revenue Impact (0-40 points total):\n- Project Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest project revenue)\n- User Total Revenue: Up to 20 points (scaled relative to highest user revenue)\n\n4. Age (0-20 points):\nLinear scale where:\n- Newest ticket = 20 points\n- Oldest ticket = 0 points\n- Other tickets scaled linearly between these points\n\nRespond with the sorted list of ticket IDs inside the tags <prioritized_tickets> </prioritized_tickets> in the following format. There should be 10 elements inside the json array\n<prioritized_tickets>\n[\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 123\n  },\n  {\n    \"ticket_id\": 987\n  }\n]\n</prioritized_tickets>\n\nInclude all tickets that you have processed in this list. Don't worry about brevity.\n"

The severity of the issue (downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request)\n2. The customer's plan level (advanced > base > free)\n3. The revenue impact (both project-specific and total user revenue)\n4. The age of the ticket (newer tickets given slightly higher priority)\n\nThe top tickets (286, 287, 143) are all related to system downtime for customers on advanced or base plans with significant revenue impact. The middle-priority tickets (288, 139, 169) involve reliability and performance issues, while the lower-priority tickets (289, 251, 166) are a mix of performance issues and feature requests, with lower revenue impact or free-tier customers."
