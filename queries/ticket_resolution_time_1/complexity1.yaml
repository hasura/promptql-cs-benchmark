  What’s the average time of resolution (in hours) for all support tickets created since {time}?

  Notes:
  1. For open or pending issues consider the time till 17-01-2025 00:00 hours
  2. Assume timezone as UTC if a timestamp doesn't have timezone

  Store the result within 2 decimal places in a text artifact called "average_resolution_time"

  Print only the number within 2 decimal places inside the tags <time></time>
  e.g
  <time>
  1000.10
