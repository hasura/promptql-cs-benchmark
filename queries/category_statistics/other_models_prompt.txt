Classify all open (status = 'open') issues into one of four categories as follows:

First, use the query_support_tickets tool to select all open tickets including their descriptions.

For each ticket do the following:

- get the description of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs,
- get the plan the project is most recently on, using the query_control_plane_data tool to fetch project and plan data,
- put the issue into one of the following four categories:
  - Free tier bug reports: if the user is in the free plan (plan name = 'free'), AND the issue description is reporting a bug.
  - Free tier non-bug reports: if the user is in the free plan, AND the issue description is NOT reporting a bug.
  - Paid tiers performance issues: if the user is NOT in the free plan, AND the issue description is specifically reporting a performance problem.
  - Paid tiers non-performance issues: if the user is NOT in the free plan, AND the issue description is NOT specifically reporting a performance problem.

The free tier plans is identified by the name 'free'. 'base' and 'advanced' are both paid plans.

Performance issues include slow response times, high latency, etc., and do not include service disruption, timeouts or downtime issues.

Tickets which are exlusively about performance issues or service disruption should not be classified as bugs.

For each category, compute a count of issues along with a mean number of days that issues have been open within that category.

For each categorization problem (bug/non-bug, performance/non-performance), do not use substring matching or other heuristics. Instead, analyze the issue description text intelligently.

Respond with a JSON object of metrics in the following format:

{
    "free_tier_bugs": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": [
        { 
          "project_id": "...",
          "issue_id": "..."
        }, 
        ...
      ]
    },
    "free_tier_non_bugs": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    "paid_tiers_performance": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    "paid_tiers_non_performance": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    ...
}

issues should be a comma-separated list of issue IDs, in increasing order.

Use a current date of 2025/01/01. issue_count should be an integer and mean_time should be reported as a number of days since 2025/01/01.

The total issue_count values should equal the number of open issues.
