Classify all open (status = 'open') issues into one of four categories as follows:

For each ticket do the following:

- get the description of the ticket
- intelligently (without heuristics) extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- put the issue into one of the following four categories:
  - Free tier bug reports: if the user is in the free plan, AND the issue description is reporting a bug.
  - Free tier non-bug reports: if the user is in the free plan, AND the issue description is NOT reporting a bug.
  - Paid tiers performance issues: if the user is NOT in the free plan, AND the issue description is specifically reporting a performance problem.
  - Paid tiers non-performance issues: if the user is NOT in the free plan, AND the issue description is NOT specifically reporting a performance problem.

For each category, compute a count of issues along with a mean number of days that issues have been open within that category.

For each categorization problem (bug/non-bug, performance/non-performance), do not use substring matching or other heuristics. Instead, analyze the issue description text intelligently.

Create an artifact containing metrics in the following format:

{
    "free_tier_bugs": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": [
        { 
          "project_id": "...",
          "issue_id": "..."
        }, 
        ...
      ]
    },
    "free_tier_non_bugs": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    "paid_tiers_performance": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    "paid_tiers_non_performance": {
      "issue_count": ...,
      "mean_time": ...,
      "issues": ...
    },
    ...
}

issues should be a list of objects consisting of issues (project_id and issue_id). 

issue_count should be an integer and mean_time should be reported as a number of days.

The total issue_count values should equal the number of open issues.
