Partition projects into the following buckets:

- Projects less than 3 months old (created after 2024/10/01)
- Projects NOT less than 3 months old but less than one year old (created before 2024/10/01 but after 2024/01/01)
- Projects NOT less than one year old (created before 2024/01/01)

For each of these buckets, compute the total number of tickets (open or closed) filed, and the average number of closed tickets (not counting open tickets) filed

Fetch tickets from the Support_Ticket table and extract project IDs (which are UUIDs) from the descriptions.

Use a current date of 2025/01/01. 

Respond with a JSON object of metrics in the following format:

{
    "new_accounts": {
        "total_tickets_filed": ...,
        "total_tickets_closed": ...,
    },
    "mid_age_accounts": {
        "total_tickets_filed": ...,
        "total_tickets_closed": ...,
    },
    "old_accounts": {
        "total_tickets_filed": ...,
        "total_tickets_closed": ...,
    }
}

Don't just tell me a query plan, actually execute your plan and show me the results.
