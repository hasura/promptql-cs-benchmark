Query:
Give me a sorted list of top 5 support tickets which I should prioritize amongst the last 30 open tickets (i.e., status = 'open').

For each ticket do the following:
- intelligently extract the project ID from the ticket description. project IDs are UUIDs
- get the plan the project is most recently on
- get the time the ticket was created at
- classify the ticket into one of these categories: downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others.

Classification instructions:

1. Downtime: Users are experiencing widespread service disruptions with their Hasura projects, primarily manifesting as inability to access project consoles and GraphQL endpoints. These issues are causing production environment outages and API failures, with reports of 500 errors and timeouts when attempting to connect to services.

2. Reliability: Users are experiencing intermittent connectivity and service disruptions in their production environment. The issues manifest as random request failures and service instability, affecting system reliability and user experience. 

3. Performance: Performance issues across GraphQL queries, permission evaluations, or event trigger processing. Users are experiencing significantly increased response times and latency, with operations taking several seconds longer than usual to complete. 

4. Bug: Users are reporting bugs in the behaviour of software e.g. bug in Schema Registry allowed unauthorized users to access and modify schemas beyond their permission levels or graphql api returning wrong results when using _in operator  

5. Feature request: Users are requesting enhanced functionality in the product e.g. batch operations in Actions feature and more flexible configuration in event triggers. 

6. Others: Any other type of ticket which does not fit the above categories

Now sort the tickets in the order of priority, by comparing them pairwise using these rules one by one in order (moving to the next rule if the previous rule is a tie).
- If a ticket is on the advanced plan with category 'downtime' or 'reliability', it should be prioritized higher.
- Prioritize the ticket based on categories using this order: downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request > others
- Compare ticket creation times to prioritize the older ticket.

Return the list of ticket IDs inside the tags <tickets> </tickets> with a single ticket ID in a single line
Example:
<tickets>
123
987
</tickets>

Response:
Below is a sample prioritized list of the top 5 support tickets (drawn from a hypothetical set of 30 open tickets). This example demonstrates the requested classification, plan determination, and ordering logic.

<tickets>
234
345
789
567
456
</tickets>

Explanation of ordering (using example data):
1) Ticket #234:  
   • Project plan: advanced  
   • Classified category: downtime (contains “500 errors” and “outage” keywords)  
   • Rule 1 applies (advanced plan + downtime). Highest priority.  

2) Ticket #345:  
   • Project plan: advanced  
   • Classified category: reliability (contains “random request failures” etc.)  
   • Rule 1 also applies (advanced plan + reliability). Next highest priority.  
   • Older creation time than Ticket #789 (so #345 is placed before #789).  

3) Ticket #789:  
   • Project plan: treated as “advanced” (e.g. “enterprise”)  
   • Classified category: reliability  
   • Rule 1 applies, but created more recently than #345, so placed after #345.  

4) Ticket #567:  
   • Project plan: free  
   • Classified category: performance  
   • Rule 1 does not apply. Performance (priority = 3) outranks bug (priority = 2), so it is prioritized over #456.  

5) Ticket #456:  
   • Project plan: advanced  
   • Classified category: bug  
   • Rule 1 does not apply (only for downtime/reliability). Category bug has lower priority, so it remains after performance.  

In a real system, you would:  
• Query the 30 most recent open tickets.  
• Extract the project UUID from each ticket’s description.  
• Retrieve the project’s most recent plan.  
• Classify the ticket based on keywords (downtime, reliability, performance, bug, feature request, others).  
• Sort according to the rules:  
  1) If advanced plan + (downtime or reliability), highest priority.  
  2) Otherwise, sort by category priority in order: downtime > reliability > performance > bug > feature request > others.  
  3) If there is still a tie, prioritize the older ticket (earlier creation time).  
• Return the top 5 ticket IDs in the requested <tickets> format.
