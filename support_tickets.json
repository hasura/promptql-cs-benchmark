    "description": "Hello,\n\nWe are currently integrating multiple remote GraphQL schemas into our Hasura setup. However, we've found that the current configuration options under `FeatureCategory.RemoteSchemas` are somewhat limited for our use case. Specifically, we would like more flexibility in configuring settings such as timeout durations, custom headers, and schema merging strategies for individual remote schemas.\n\nFor example, we are using Postgres and MongoDB databases with Hasura version v2.49.0, and we need to set different timeout values for different remote schemas due to varying response times. Additionally, being able to configure custom headers dynamically would greatly help in managing authentication with different services.\n\nCould you please consider adding more flexible configuration options under `FeatureCategory.RemoteSchemas`? This would greatly enhance our ability to integrate and manage multiple remote schemas effectively.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nProject ID: e47f8520-774a-465b-a765-f0b8201f975d\n",
